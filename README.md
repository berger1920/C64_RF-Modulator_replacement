# C64 RF-Modulator replacement

This circuit replaces the original RF modulator of the Commodore 64.

It's based on this project by ![c0pperdragon](https://github.com/c0pperdragon):

The differences are:

1) It's only valid for the regular motherboard version (short motherboard compatibility omitted).
2) The PCB has been made bigger to cover the whole space of the old RF modulator.
3) Two outuput connectors have been added, one for Composite Video and one for Audio.

Here you can find the design for its manufacture and manual assembly:
